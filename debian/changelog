  * dev-container
  * Cleanup ROS package.xml and CMakeLists.txt (#337 <https://github.com/LCAS/kiss-icp/issues/337>)
    Add missing system dependencies as wel
  * Change target names (#327 <https://github.com/LCAS/kiss-icp/issues/327>)
    * Change target names
    * This can be reverted, but it is related

    This reverts commit 59b5d21607e66883ad71fa6b3ad3463075515d4a.
  * Refactor KissICP pipeline to mantain just 1 pose instead of full trajectory. Fixes #122 <https://github.com/LCAS/kiss-icp/issues/122> (#318 <https://github.com/LCAS/kiss-icp/issues/318>)
    * First draft for fixed_size_vector. Fixes #122 <https://github.com/LCAS/kiss-icp/issues/122>

    * Keep copy-pasting ðŸ¤¦
    * Move poses array one level up, and add new deskew function to python API
    Now I like it even better. The pipeline is in charge of managing the
    trajectory of poses, as the KISS ICP method is invariant to this.
    * Renaming of Registration types and functions

  * Clean leftover from merge conflicts (#301 <https://github.com/LCAS/kiss-icp/issues/301>)
    The logger should be kiss_icp_node, not odometry_Node
  * Fix and improve ROS visualization (#285 <https://github.com/LCAS/kiss-icp/issues/285>)
    * Fix this madness
    Simplify implementation by debugging in an ego-centric way always.
    Since the KISS-ICP internal map is on the global coordinates, fetch the
    last ego-centric pose and apply it to the map. Seen from the
    cloud_frame_id (which is the sensor frame) everything should always work
    in terms of visualization, no matter the multi-sensor setup.
    * Now is safe to disable this by default
    * Simplify, borrow the header from the input pointcloud msg
    This actually makes the visualization closer to the Python visualizer
    * Disable path/odom visualization by default
    In the case where we are not computing the poses in an egocentric world
    (base_frame != "") and we are not publishing to the TF tree, then the
    visualization wouldn't make sense. Therefore, disable it by default
    * Changed my mind
    If someone doesn't have that particular frame defined, then the
    visualization won't work. Leave this default
    * Move responsability of handling tf frames out of Registration (#288 <https://github.com/LCAS/kiss-icp/issues/288>)
    * Move responsability of handling tf frames out of Registration
    Since with this new changes PublishOdometry is the only member that
    requieres to know the user specified target-frame, it is not necesary to
    handle all this bits.
    This makes the implementation cleaner, easier to read and reduces the
    lines of code. Now RegisterFrame is a simple callback as few months ago
    one can read in seconds.
    * typo
    * Easier to read
    * We need this for LookupTransform
    * Remove unused variable
    * Revert "Remove unused variable"
    This reverts commit 424ee901c5442ef1f1651f48079c8cbf5a3f10bf.
    * Remove unnecessary check
    * Remove unnecessary exposed utility function from ROS API
    With this change this function is not exposed (which was never the
    intention to) to the header. This way we can also "hide" this into a
    private unnamed namesapces and benefit from inlining the simple function
    into the translation unit

    This reverts commit 23cd7efafd133c4f209f8575d079dee2d14702ae.

    * too many merges
    * Merge Rviz and Python colors
    * Just make the default construction more clear
    ---------
    Co-authored-by: tizianoGuadagnino <mailto:frevo93@gmail.com>
  * Refactor ROS parametrization (#282 <https://github.com/LCAS/kiss-icp/issues/282>)
    * Move ros params from launch file to YAML
    * Reuse arguments for debug clouds
    * Rename odometry_node to kiss_icp_node
    odometry is way to generic
    * Rename node agin
    * Voxel size is optional paramter
    * Reads better like this
    * New parameter proposal

    * Add fixed covariance to odometry msg

    * pre-commit
    * Expose number of icp iterations in ros (#292 <https://github.com/LCAS/kiss-icp/issues/292>)
    * Expose registration params to ROS node
    * More merge conflicts
    * Default to multithread
  * Remove unnecesary path publishing pipeline (#284 <https://github.com/LCAS/kiss-icp/issues/284>)
  * Auto 2257 fix double construction kiss icp cpp (#294 <https://github.com/LCAS/kiss-icp/issues/294>)
    * First stop. Remove default constructor
    Since we can't guarantee how the pipeline is going to be constructed at
    runtime is better to force the user to wrap it in a pointer type to
    avoid having a default-constructed object that "should" be modified
    later on
    * Second stop: make the only kiss_icp::pipeline::KissICP consumer use ptr
    This way we guarantee that it's constructed once the config_ has been
    properly populated
    * Last stop: rename "odometry_" for "kiss_icp_"
    * Remove unnecessary class member
    * format
    * Remove unnncesary duplicated call
    * Update utility function to accoomodate for empty timestamps

ros-humble-kiss-icp (0.3.0-1jammy) jammy; urgency=high

  * Nacho/re enable ipc (#253 <https://github.com/LCAS/kiss-icp/issues/253>)
    * Add composable launch example
    * Use SensorDataQoS() as default to enable IPC
    * Change rviz configuration
    * Use unique_ptr to allow for true IPC
    * Move component registration to translation unit
    It's the same but seems to be a more common practice in ROS 2 codebases
    * Fix sytle
    * Delete unnecessary unique_ptrs after PR conversation
  * Add support for multi-sensor scenarios (#232 <https://github.com/LCAS/kiss-icp/issues/232>)
    * Fix TF tree usage in ROS 2 wrapper
    * Transform the pose instead of the pointcloud
    * remove include
    * Remove default base_frame parameter value
    This will make KISS-ICP work ego-centric as default
    * Remove unused variable
    * Do not reuse pose_msg.pose
    * I'm not ever sure why we did that in first instance
    * Be more explicit about the stamps and frame_id of the headers
    * Extract publishing mechanism to a new function (#246 <https://github.com/LCAS/kiss-icp/issues/246>)
    * Convert class member function to more useful utility
    And fix a small bug, the order was of the transformation before was the
    opposite, and therefore we were obtaining base2cloud. Since we multiply
    by both sides we can't really see the difference, but it was
    conceptually wrong.
    * Bring back debugging clouds to ros driver
    * re-arange logic on when and when not to publish clouds
    * fix lofic
    * Update rviz2
    * Loosing my mind already with this debugging info
